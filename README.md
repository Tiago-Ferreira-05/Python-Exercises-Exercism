# Python-Exercises-Exercism

This repository contains my solutions to the Python exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/python).  
Each file corresponds to the solution for a specific exercise.  

## üìÇ Structure
- The repository groups all solution files (`.py`) together in a single folder for convenience.
- Each file name matches the original exercise name from Exercism.

## üèÜ Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Document my learning progress with Python.
- Serve as a reference for others working through the same exercises.
- Showcase clean, functional, and readable solutions.

## üöÄ How to Use
You can browse the files to check my approach to solving the exercises.  
Each file is standalone and can be run with:

```bash
python file_name.py
```

(Replace `file_name.py` with the name of the file you want to test.)
